# ray-tracer

Another implementation of Ray Tracing In One Weekend + The Next Week by Peter Shirley.
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Tried to commit the various steps of the books as separate commits and images to make it easier to follow along.

Note this uses lfs as assets are a stored directly in the repo.
